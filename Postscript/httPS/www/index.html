<H2>Why Would Anyone Want To Do This?</H2>

</CENTER>

Postscript is langauge mainly centered around PDFs and graphics. I personally have no interest in making graphics or fractals so I decided to see if an HTTP server was possible with a language that doesnt support basic network functions. <P>
    

    The inspiration behind this project came from a similar project where someone created a HTTP server in bash.<P>
    

    <H2>The 3 basic components to an HTTP server are</H2><P>
    &emsp;         - Read the commmand<P>
    &emsp;         - Check if the connection is persistent<P>
    &emsp;         - Respond to the request<P>


    <H2>Lets Prove This is PostScript</H2>

    If we look at the headers of the request in developer tools we see various things:<P>
    &emsp; - The server responding is httPS/1.6<P>
    &emsp; - The relative content length<P>
    &emsp; - The relative content type<P>
    &emsp; - Along with a request for the title picture above<P>

    <H2>Now that we have seen the headers that are required lets look at examples of content we can serve:</H2><P>
